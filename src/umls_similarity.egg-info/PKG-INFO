# UMLS-Similarity

Estimate similarity of medical concepts based on Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)

## Installation

First of all, please install Perl environment ([Strawberry](https://strawberryperl.com/)).
   
### For WordNet use:
1. Download the [WordNet-2.1](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/old-versions) if you want to use WordNet Similarity (if not, please skip)
2. Set WNHome environment variables (if you need WordNet Similarity)
3. Install WordNet::QueryData via `cpanm` command in perl
4. Install WordNet::Similarity via `cpanm` command in perl

### For UMLS use:
1. Install MySQL and WorkBench, the MySQL Home folder should not have space in its path;
2. Download UMLS and extract the subset;
3. Goto UMLS's META and NET folders and Load UMLS data into MySQL database with scripts: Ref: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/scripts/README_RRF_MySQL_Output_Stream.html;
4. Install Perl (Strawberry) environment;
5. Install necessary libs with 'cpanm' command like below:
6. `cpanm UMLS::Interface --force`

Issue: need to fix the problem of UMLS::Interface that is unable to install due to mysql connecting issue

Solution: adding fixed username and password in Line 721 in CuiFinder.pm from the distribution files and try again.
7. `cpanm UMLS::Similarity`
8. `cpanm UMLS::Similarity::lch --force` if error occurs
9. Please check if you have installed DBI, DBD::mysql; install them if not;

Issue: mysql.xs.dll not found problem: https://github.com/perl5-dbi/DBD-mysql/issues/318

Solution: Copying C:\strawberry\c\bin\libmysql.dll_ to c:\strawberry\perl\vendor\lib\auto\mysql 

### Finally, install the umls-similrity package via pip

```pip
pip install umls-similarity
```

## Let Codes Speak
Example Code 1: Estimate similarity between two medical concepts using UMLS
```python
from umls_similarity import UMLSSimilarity
import os

if __name__=="__main__":
    # define MySQL information that stores UMLS data in your computer
    mysql_info = {}
    mysql_info["database"] = "umls"
    mysql_info["username"] = "root"
    mysql_info["password"] = "{I am not gonna tell you}"
    mysql_info["hostname"] = "localhost"

    # Perl bin's path which will be automatically detected by the lib, but you can also manually specify in its constructor
    # perl_bin_path = r"C:\Strawberry\perl\bin\perl"

    # create an instance
    umls_sim = UMLSSimilarity(mysql_info=mysql_info)

    # processing many CUI pairs from a text file where each line is formatted like 'C0006949<>C0031507'
    current_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
    sims =umls_sim.similarity_from_file(current_path+r"\cuis_umls_sim.txt",measure="lch")
    for sim in sims:
        print(sim)

    # Or directly pass two CUIs into the function below:
    sims = umls_sim.similarity(cui1="C0017601", cui2="C0232197", measure="lch")
    print(sims[0]) # only one pair with two concepts

```
Example Code 2: Estimate similarity between concept using WordNet (version 2.1)
```python
from wn_similarity import WNSimilarity

if __name__=="__main__":
    
    wn_root_path=r"C:\Program Files (x86)\WordNet\2.1"
    # perl_bin_path=r"C:\Strawberry\perl\bin\perl"

    var1 = "dog#n#1"
    var2 = "orange#n#1"

    wn_sim=WNSimilarity(wn_root_path=wn_root_path)

    sims = wn_sim.similarity(var1, var2)
    print(sims)

    for k, v in enumerate(sims):
        print(k, '\t', v, '\t', sims[v])
```

## Credit

This project is a wrapper of the Perl library of [UMLS::Similarity](https://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/umls-similarity.html) and [UMLS::Interface](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~btmcinnes/software/umls-interface.html). 

Note: There are plenty of issues to fix during the installation of the UMLS::Similarity libraries because I am not familiar with Perl and its library use.
