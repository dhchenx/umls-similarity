This is a master list of comments as used in the example configuration  
files found in this directory. This is not intended to be used as a 
configuration file but rather as a plain text summary of possible options  
and their values. In fact, the measures will not accept this as a  
configuration file.

All of these options have default values that are described below. The  
only exception to this is vectordb, which has no default. If an option is  
listed without a value (as in trace:: or cache:: ), then the default value  
is used. 

Note that in the configuration files anything following a # is treated as  
a comment, so the following text can be used directly in a configuration 
file. You will want to make sure to change the value of an option as fits 
your needs however!

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported for all measures

trace::0        # Turns off (0) tracing. Turn on tracing by setting
                # to 1 or 2. The effect of these different levels will
		# depend on the measure being used. The default value 
		# is off (0). If the value is omitted, then the default  
		# is used. 0, 1, and 2 are the only valid settings.

cache::1        # Turns on (1) caching. Turn off caching by setting 
                # to 0. The default is on (1). If the value is omitted,
                # then the default is used. 0 and 1 are the only valid
		# settings.

maxCacheSize::1000 

		# Limit the cache size to 1000 pairs of query words.
                # The default is 5000.  If the value is omitted, then
		# the default is used.  The value of this option
                # must be a non-negative integer or "unlimited" (without
                # the quotes). 

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following option is supported by :
# 		path, lch, wup, res, lin, jcn

rootNode::1     # Turns on (1) a (hypothetical) top-level root node for
		# the nouns, and another for the verbs. Turn off the 
		# root nodes by setting to 0.  The default is to use (1) 
		# a unique top-level root node.  If the value is omitted,
		# then the default is used.  0 and 1 are the only valid
		# settings.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following option is supported by :
# 		res, lin, jcn

infocontent::lib/WordNet/infocontent.dat

                # Specifies an information content file. The value of
		# this option must be the name of a file, or a relative
		# or absolute path name. The default value of this option 
		# is $INSTALLDIR/WordNet/ic-semcor.dat, where $INSTALLDIR 
		# is the directory in which the WordNet::Similarity modules 
		# are installed.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported by vector and lesk

stem::1         # Turns on (1) stemming. Turn off stemming by setting
		# this value to 0. The default value is on (1). If the
		# value is omitted, then the default is used.  When 
		# stemming is on (1), all the words in a gloss are stemmed 
		# by the WordNet stemmer before overlaps are identified.

stop::samples/stoplist.txt

                # Specifies the name of a stop list, which consists of
		# words that are to be ignored in a gloss overlap. The
		# value of this must be a file name, or an absolute or
		# relative path name. The default is to not use a stop
		# list. If the value is omitted, then the default is used.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported by the lesk measure

relation::samples/lesk-relation.dat

                # Specifies a lesk relation file. This value can be a file 
		# name, or an absolute or relative path name. The default 
		# is to use the file $INSTALLDIR/WordNet/lesk-relation.dat, 
		# where $INSTALLDIR is the directory in which the 
		# WordNet::Similarity modules are installed. If the value is 
		# ommited, then the default is used. Please note that the 
		# format of the lesk relation file is not the same as 
		# that of the vector relation file. The lesk relation file
		# consists of relation pairs that specify glosses that 	
		# are to be compared for overlaps. 


normalize::1    # Turns on (1) normalization of lesk scoring. Turn off
		# by setting this value to 0. The default value is off 
		# (0).  If the  value is omitted, then the default is used.  
		# When normalization is enabled, the gloss overlap score 
		# is normalized by the size of the glosses. The details 
		# are described in Banerjee and Pedersen (2002).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported by the vector measure

vectordb::lib/WordNet/wordvectors.dat

                # Specifies a database file containing word vectors.
		# The value of this option must be a file name, or an
		# absolute or relative path name. utils/wordVectors.pl 
		# must be used to generate this file. This option is
		# required, and there is no default value. If the 
		# option is not specified, or if the option is specified
		# without a value, the vector measure will fail. 

relation::samples/vector-relation.dat

                # Specifies a vector relation file. This value can be a file 
		# name, or an absolute or relative path name. The default 
		# is to use the glos-example relation. If the value is 
		# ommited, then the default is used. Please note that the 
		# format of the vector relation file is not the same as 
		# that of the lesk relation file. The vector relation file
		# consists of single relations that specify which glossess
		# of a word will be used in constructing the gloss vector.

compounds::samples/wn30compounds.txt

                # Specifies a file of WordNet compounds. The value of
		# this option must be a file name, or an absolute or 
		# relative path. The program utils /compounds.pl can 
		# be used to generate this file. When compounds are 
		# specified, compound words that occur in glosses are
		# identified prior to creating word vectors. The default 
		# is to ignore compound words. If the value of this 
		# option is omitted, then the default is used.  

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following option is supported by the random measure

maxrand::1	# The random measure will generate measures between 0
		# and this value. The value of this option may be an
		# integer or a real number. The default value is 1. 
		# If the value of this option is omitted, then the 
		# default is used. 

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
